# Export Microsoft 365 Email Activity to SQL Server 📊

This PowerShell project retrieves email activity details of selected users from **Microsoft 365** via the **Microsoft Graph API**, and inserts them into a **SQL Server** table — making it possible to visualize and analyze the data in **Power BI** or any reporting system.

---

## 🔧 Use Cases
 
- Track email send/receive counts for specific users or departments
- Monitor internal communication trends
- Feed clean data into **Power BI dashboards** for analysis
- Detect anomalies or identify inactive users

---

## 💡 What This Script Does

1. Authenticates to Microsoft Graph using **client credentials (OAuth2)**  
2. Downloads **email activity user details** for the past 7 days  
3. Filters the report for specific users (defined by email)  
4. Automatically creates the required table in SQL Server if it doesn't exist  
5. Inserts the filtered data (username, send/receive counts, date range) into SQL  
6. Prepares clean, structured data ready for **Power BI visualization**

   ```powershell
    .\EmailActivity-To-SQL.ps1

## 📈 Visualize in Power BI

After data is inserted into SQL Server:

1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Go to Home > Get Data > SQL Server
3. Connect to your server and select the table (e.g. EmailActivity)
